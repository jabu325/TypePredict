the following is a simple project which i created to keep up with typing speed because some keys on my keyboard are not functional

i can no longer perform 60 words per second but im okay with 20

Now the setup is quite simple all you need is to 

1. install the autohotkey.exe v1.1 in the Dependacies folder [this will enable you to open the TypePrdict script]
2. right click on the TypePrdict script
3. wait for the yellow popup on your left screen and your set

lastly this solution is in its early stages so the following issues occur
1. the yellow popup cannot be moved once it appears unless by closing the autohotkey progam in the hidden item tray on your pc
2. once the progam is running the number keys get disabled until you close the progam.., but if you have a number section on the right of your keyboard then your good
3. hit spacebar to whipe the words in the register before you move to the next word

    Now this solution isnt solid but i believe with time it will be..., the TypePrdict script is simple and can be modified to suit your situation e.g number 2, 6, 7. dont work
   on my keyboard so im off to modify TypePrdict script to generate suggestions as 1, 3, 4.... .
